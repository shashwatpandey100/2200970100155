This repository contains two main folders:

1. Logging Middleware

   - contains a reusable logging middleware for ExpressJS.
   - includes a logger.js file.

2. Backend Test Submission
   - contains URL Shortener microservice built with ExpressJS.

Each folder has its own README file with setup and usage instructions.

Note:
I chose to implement only the core shortener functionality per time constraints.
